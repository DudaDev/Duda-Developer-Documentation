# Introduction

### About Custom Widgets

Duda's Widget Builder allows you to build your own custom widgets and make them available to your customers. You can design widgets which look and act exactly like all other Duda widgets found in the website editor. The Widget Builder allows you to integrate with third-party services or provide a new design element and include all the functionality that you want.

Custom Widgets are built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and support standard Duda input options for both the content and design of widgets, to help maintain consistency of UI and experience for customers building websites.
