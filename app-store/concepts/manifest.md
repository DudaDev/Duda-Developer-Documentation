# Manifest

The App Manifest is the core configuration of your App inside of Duda. It contains all configurable options for how your App works inside of the Duda platform.

This includes the following aspects:

* [Lifecycle Events](../tutorials/lifecycle-events.md), SSO Endpoints and more.
* [Scopes](../reference/scopes.md)
* [Webhooks](../reference/webhooks.md)
* Plan Configuration: [Payments for Apps](../tutorials/payments-for-apps.md)
* [App Profile Details](../tutorials/profile-guidelines.md)

Today, the [manifest can only be updated via API](../../reference/app-store-api-reference/manifest.md).

The manifest should be managed carefully, as configuring it incorrectly can break your integration or cause bigger issues in the long term. Make sure you also read [our tutorial on deploying and releasing](../tutorials/deploying-and-releasing-apps.md), to understand better the lifecycle of managing the App Manifest.
