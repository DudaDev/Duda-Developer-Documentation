# Introduction

The Editor JS API allows you to extend the functionality of Duda’s editor for your users by using Javascript in your Custom Branding HTML. You can listen for several editor-specific events that contain contextual information related to the event and provide callback functionality for those events. In addition, you can access global data such as the current account and site being edited, and perform UI actions such as opening custom popups.

Duda partners have used the Editor JS API to add support links, customize publish flows, or provide additional contextual help for users customizing their sites.
