# Content Injection

Content Injection allows you to update site content using Duda's API instead of opening the editor. It's a great option for pushing new site content and creating templates without using a site's Content Library to store the data.

Content Injection provides you a way to identify a particular element and target it to change a few common properties, which we call Content Types. There are three types of content available to you when using Content Injection: innerHTML, DOM attributes, and CSS rules.

### innerHTML

If you're familiar with HTML & Javascript, this one is pretty self-explanatory. innerHTML enables you to update an element's `innerHTML` property to include different text, child elements, or other content. For example, a common use case would be to update the headline and subheadline after creating a new site from a template.

### DOM Attributes

The DOM Attribute content type allows you to update a specific attribute of an element. For example, you can change an anchor tag's `href` attribute or assign a custom data attribute that you reference in custom JavaScript.

### CSS Rules

The CSS Rule content type allows you to update any style property of an element. For example, you could change the `transition` property of an element to alter its animation so that returning site visitors receive a slightly different experience during their next visit.
