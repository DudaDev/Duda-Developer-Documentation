# Site Creation

Automating the creation of a website is a typical first step in integration with the Duda platform. There are a variety of ways to do this. We will list out some common patterns below and link to more details for each (where available).

### Do It Yourself

Do It Yourself, or DIY, is an end user-initiated process that creates a new website. This is normally triggered from a website external to Duda. Duda's API is used to complete all the necessary steps to allow a user to create a website and immediately begin managing the site in the Duda editor.

### Instant Websites

Instant Websites are a great way to fully (or partially) automate the content collection for a website. It involves pushing content to the Duda Content Library via our API. In some cases this content already exists in a partner's CRM or database. When an instant website is created for one of your customers you can automatically push content (ex. business phone number, address, logo, business hours, etc...) to display on the site.

In other cases you can prompt your customer or internal employee to fill out a form collecting pieces of content. This form should connect to the Duda content library via the API. Learn how to build an Instant Website workflow on Duda.

### Do It For Me

Do It For Me, or DIFM, is a designer lead initiative to get a customer's website created and published. Normally the designer creates the website manually through the [Duda dashboard](https://my.duda.co/) and begins building. Once the design is complete feedback is gathered from the customer, updates are made to the site and finally it is published. This workflow can include many features like custom templates, sections and widgets. It can also take advantage of [site comments](https://www.duda.co/website-builder/site-comments) to collect feedback from the customer.
