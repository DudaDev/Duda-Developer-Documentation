# Users

Duda offer two different types of users. One is Clients which represent your customers. The other type of user is a Team Member which is an internal user who has access to your sites. Learn more about each below.

### Clients

Client, also known as Customer, accounts represent the site owner. These are typically your customer accounts. Each of these accounts must be granted access to each site you would like them to have access to. When granting an account access to a site you can specify what permissions are available for that site.

Learn more about [granting site access to a client](../tutorials/site-access-and-permissions.md) and [client permissions](../tutorials/site-access-and-permissions.md).

Duda provides two ways for a client account with access to a site to authenticate and interact with the site.

* Single Sign-On
* Login Credentials

### Team Members

Team Member, also known as Staff, accounts represent an internal user who has access to work on sites. The level of access is determined by the permissions granted to that account. Team member accounts have access to all sites in your Duda account.
