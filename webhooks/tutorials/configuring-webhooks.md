# Configuring Webhooks

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Heads up: Custom Plans Only**

In order to access this feature, schedule a time to speak with a member of our Partner Team about upgrading your account to a Custom plan.

To start receiving webhook notifications, the Duda team will need to configure webhooks for your Duda account in our system. Once you have all requirements ready, [submit a request for access](https://support.duda.co/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our support team with the relevant information.

### Webhook Requirements

You’ll need to make sure you have the following items ready:

* An endpoint on a secure (HTTPS) server to consume webhook.
* A list of the [webhook events](../reference/) you would like to receive.

Once you receive confirmation that your webhook(s) have been configured, you will immediately start receiving webhook notifications as soon as someone interacts with the feature triggering your webhook event.
